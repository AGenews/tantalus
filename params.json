{"name":"Tantalus","tagline":"This little app allows you to score behavior. ","body":"### Welcome to Tantalus\r\nTantalus is a very simple program which easily runs on Linux, OSX and even Windows. It allows you to manually score e.g. freezing & digging behavior typically observed in behavioral experiments.\r\n\r\n### Why the name?\r\n[Tantalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalus) (lat.) or Tántalos (greek) is a Greek mythological figure most famous for his eternal punishment. I myself am a biologist and typically dislike experiments with negative affect to a certain degree - which is the main reason why I've picked that particular name.\r\n\r\n### What is Tantalus?\r\nAdmittedly it is a very ugly replacement for an even uglier predecessor (written in 1986 for DOS). But my plans for May-July 2016 are to  make a better version of it.-\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
